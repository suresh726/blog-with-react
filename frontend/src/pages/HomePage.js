      Sometimes, the best blog designs are also the simplest. Help Scout, makers of customer service software, uses a unique but minimalist design on its blog that we love — it limits the use of scopy and visuals and embraces negative space.

      What we particularly like about this blog is its use of featured images for all posts, including a banner one at the top that highlights a recent or particularly popular entry.
      These icons are set in front of bright, block colors that catch the readers' eye and signal what the post is about. And it works — everything about this blog's design says "clean" and "readable."</p>
